## Setup

* Fork this repository
* Clone down your forked repository
* Perform the usual setup steps after cloning a Rails application:
  - `bundle install`
  - `rake db:{create,migrate,seed}`
* When you run `bundle exec rspec`, you should have 16 examples, and 6 failing tests.
* You will also be starting with your db migrations, and seeds ready for you to use in development, and for you to use in your tests if you'd like.
* Do not get these to pass yet.
